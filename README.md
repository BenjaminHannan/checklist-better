# Checklist Calendar

A calendar-style checklist app you can open anywhere (home, school, or on the go) for free. It runs entirely in the browser and stores your data locally, so there’s nothing to install and no account required.

## Features

- **Calendar layout** with month navigation and a today shortcut.
- **Class categories** with color tags so you can group tasks by subject.
- **Per-day task lists** with completion toggles and notes.
- **Quick add** panel to drop tasks onto any day.
- **Filters** to focus on a single class or hide completed items.
- **Export/Import** to move your data between devices (home/school).

## Getting started

### Option 1: Open locally
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

### Option 2: Host it for free (recommended for home + school)
You can publish this app on GitHub Pages so you can open it from anywhere.

1. Create a GitHub repository and push this project.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Set the source to the `main` branch and `/root` folder.
4. Save and wait for the URL to appear.
5. Open that URL on any device.

> Tip: Use the **Export** button at home and the **Import** button at school if you want to sync your tasks across browsers.

## File overview

- `index.html` – main layout and UI.
- `styles.css` – styling and layout.
- `app.js` – data model, calendar rendering, and interactions.

## Ideas to make it even better

- Add reminders with browser notifications.
- Add a weekly agenda list view.
- Connect to Google Calendar for automatic sync.
- Add a “study streak” tracker for motivation.
